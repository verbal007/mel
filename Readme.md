# Maya MEL Scripts for Rigging
This is a collection of the Maya MEL scripts that I built and used from 2002 till 2012. As these tools were built in MEL, most of them still work properly.
However, I have not had the opportunity to go through to verify and clean out the library.
This means some tools included were very specific to the pipelines they were used within.
With that being said, even these scripts might contain some bits and pieces that could provide use cases for functions or nodes to inspire your own work.
As I've been holding off on the cleanup task for years, I eventually realized that sharing a potentially useful mess, is better than it degrading further on my hard drive.
